# Report a Crime

**Report a Crime** is a platform designed to empower individuals, especially the voiceless and vulnerable, to report crimes either **anonymously** or **openly**.
It aims to bridge the gap between victims or witnesses and the appropriate authorities, helping create safer communities through technology.

## Purpose
In many communities today, people often stay silent due to fear, lack of trust in authorities, or feeling powerless.
This platform exists to change that, giving anyone the ability to speak up and report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation.

## Key Features

- **Anonymous or Public Reporting**  
  Users can submit reports anonymously or with their identity attached.

- **User Dashboard**  
  Registered users have access to a personal dashboard to view and manage their reports.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  Admins can view, manage, and track all submitted crime reports efficiently.

- **Crime Data Visualization (Bar Chart)**  
  Displays bar charts showing crime distribution to help identify trends and hotspots.

## Technologies Used

- **C# (.NET Core)** ‚Äì Backend API
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** ‚Äì Frontend
- **SignalR** ‚Äì Real-time messaging
- **Google Charts / Maps API** ‚Äì Crime data visualization
- **IPinfo API** ‚Äì Geolocation from IP address
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Relational database for storing reports and user data

## Deployment

This project is currently **not hosted** online. It runs locally and was developed primarily for **learning and demonstration purposes**.
Hosting may be considered in the future as the project evolves, because no one knows tomorrow.

## Current Status
The platform's core features are fully functional. Additional implementations and improvements are ongoing and will continue at a steady pace. Planned enhancements include:
- **Real-time notifications using SignalR**
- **Advanced filtering and data analytics**
- **Integration with external reporting authorities**
